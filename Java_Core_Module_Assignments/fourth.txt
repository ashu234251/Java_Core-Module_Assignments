Q1. Write a program to show Interface Example in java?
    interface ABC
    {
	public void f1();
	public void f2();
     }
    public class practice implements ABC
    {

	public void f1()
	{
		System.out.println("This is f1 method..");
	}
	public void f2()
	{
		System.out.println("This is f2 method..");
	}
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		ABC a1=new practice();
		a1.f1();
		a1.f2();
	}
      }

Q2.Write a program a Program with 2 concrete method and 2 abstract method in java ?
    abstract class ABC
    {
	public abstract void f1();
	public abstarct void f2();
        public void f3()
        {
           System.out.println("This is f3 method..");
	}
        public void f4()
	{
           System.out.println("This is f4 method..");
	}
     }
    public class practice extends ABC
    {

	public void f1()
	{
		System.out.println("This is f1 method..");
	}
	public void f2()
	{
		System.out.println("This is f2 method..");
	}
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		ABC a1=new practice();
		a1.f1();
		a1.f2();
	}
      }

Q3.Write a program  to show the use of functional interface in java?
   interface ABC
   {
	public int f1(int a,int b);
   }
   public class practice 
   {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		ABC a1=(a,b)->a+b;
	    System.out.println("Value is: "+a1.f1(10, 15));
	}
   }

Q4.What is an interface in Java?
   The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface, not method body. It is used to 
   achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

Q5.What is the use of interface in Java?
   It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

Q6.What is the lambda expression of Java 8?
   In Java, Lambda expressions basically express instances of functional interfaces (An interface with a single abstract method is 
   called a functional interface). Lambda Expressions in Java are the same as lambda functions which are the short block of code that 
   accepts input as parameters and returns a resultant value. Lambda Expressions are recently included in Java SE 8. 

Q7.Can you pass lambda expressions to a method? When?
   Yes.

Q8.What is the functional interface in Java 8?
   Interface with only one method is called as Functional Interface.

Q9.What is the benefit of lambda expressions in Java 8?
   Conciseness, readability,Flexibility,Parallelism, Improved Api

Q10.Is it mandatory for a lambda expression to have parameters?
   No
