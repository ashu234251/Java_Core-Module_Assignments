Q1. What are the Conditional Operators in Java?
    There are three types of the conditional operator in Java:
    1. Conditional AND  (&&)
    2. Conditional OR   (||)
    3. Ternary Operator (?)

Q2. What are the types of operators based on the number of operands?
    + – * /	                Arithmetic unary or binary operators
    ++ —	                Increment and decrement unary operators
    == !=	                Equality operators
    < > <= =>	                Relational operators
    ! & |	                Logical operators
    && || ?:         	        Conditional operators
    = += -= *= /= %=	        Assignment operators
    &= |= ^= <<= >>= >>>=	Assignment operators
    & | ~ ^ << >> >>>	        Bitwise operators
    -> ::	                Arrow and method reference operators
    new	                        Instance creation iterator
    instanceOf	                Type comparison operator
    +	                        String concatenation operator

Q3.What is the use of Switch case in Java programming?
   The Java switch statement executes one statement from multiple conditions. 

Q4.What are the conditional Statements and use of conditional statements in Java?
   if-->     An if statement executes a block of code when a specified boolean expression is evaluated as true; otherwise, the block of code will be
             skipped.
   else-->   The else statement executes a block of code when the condition inside the if statement is false:
   else-if--> else if statements can be chained together to check multiple conditions. Once a condition is true, a code block will be executed and     
             theconditional statement will be exited.
   Nested--> A nested conditional statement is a conditional statement nested inside another conditional

Q5.What is the syntax of if else statement?
   if(true)
    {  }
    else
    {  }

Q6.How do you compare two strings in Java?
   In Java, string equals() method compares the two given strings based on the data/content of the string. If all the contents of both the strings are
   same then it returns true. If any character does not match, then it returns false.

Q7.What is Mutable String in Java Explain with an example
   A mutable string is a type of String object that can be changed or modified. Any changes made to the String are done in-place, which means that the
   data stored in the String still exists and the memory allocation is not changed.
   eg; In java, Strings are immutable, while StringBuffer and StringBuilder are of Mutable nature.

Q8.Write a program to sort a String Alphabetically
    char tempArray[] = inputString.toCharArray();
    Arrays.sort(tempArray);
    return new String(tempArray);

Q9.Write a program to check if the letter 'e' is present in the word
   for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++)
   {
     if(str[i]=='e')
        return true;
   }

Q10.Where exactly is the string constant pool located in the memory.
   The String constant pool is a special memory area. When we declare a String literal, the JVM creates the object in the pool and stores its reference stack. 
   Before creating each String object in memory, the JVM performs some steps to decrease the memory overhead.
   The String constant pool uses a Hashmap in its implementation. Each bucket of the Hashmap contains a list of Strings with the same hash code.
   In earlier versions of Java, the storage area for the pool was a fixed size and could often lead to the “Could not reserve enough space for object heap” error.
