Q1.What is Exception in Java?
  Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program, i.e. at run 
  time, that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions. 

Q2.What is Exception Handling?
   Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException, IOException,    
   SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

Q3.What is the difference between Checked and Unchecked Exceptions and Error?
   Checked Exceptions are those, for which compiler gives the error and the program can't be executed without handling it.
   Unchecked Exceptions are those, forn which no warning is generated by compiler.

Q4.What are the difference between throw and throws in Java?
   throw is used to pass the control to the different method.
   throws is used to duck the exception without handling it.

Q5.What is multithreading in Java? mention its advantages
  Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a seperate independent part of the same program.
  Each independent part is  called thread.
  The main advantage is to reduce the response time of the system and to improve the performance.

Q6.Write a program to create and call a custom exception
   class UnderAgeException extends Exception
    {
	public UnderAgeException(String message)
	{
		super(message);
	}
   }
   class OverAgeException extends Exception
   {
	public OverAgeException(String message)
	{
		super(message);
	}

   }


   class Applicant
   {
	int age;
	public void input()
	{
		Scanner scan=new Scanner(System.in);
		System.out.println("Please enter your age");
		age=scan.nextInt();
	}
	//void verify() throws Exception
	void verify() throws UnderAgeException,OverAgeException
	{
		if(age <18)
		{
			UnderAgeException uae=new UnderAgeException("Ohh dude? calm down your time will come");
			System.out.println(uae.getMessage());
			throw uae;
		}
		else if(age > 60)
		{
			OverAgeException oae=new OverAgeException("your time is near calm down and pray");
			System.out.println(oae.getMessage());
			throw oae;
		}
	        else
		{
			System.out.println("You're eligible");
		}
       	  }
      }

     class Rto
      {
	  public void initiate()
	  {
		Applicant a=new Applicant();
		try
		{
		a.input();
		a.verify();
		}
		catch(UnderAgeException| OverAgeException e)
		{
			try
		{
		a.input();
		a.verify();
		}
		catch(UnderAgeException |OverAgeException e1)
		{
			System.out.println("Don't ever try again read rules");
			System.exit(0);
		}
			
			
		}
	 }
     }


    public class LaunchRto  
    {

	public static void main(String[] args) 
       {
		Rto r=new Rto();
		r.initiate();

	}

    }


Q7.How can you handle exceptions in Java? 
   Using try-catch block
   By ducking the Exception
   By re-throwing an error.

Q8.What is Thread in Java?
   Seperate flow of execution is called an thread.

Q9. What are the two ways of implementing thread in Java?
    1. By extending the Thread class
    2. By implementing Runnable interface.

Q10.What do you mean by garbage collection?
    Garbage collection in Java is the process by which Java programs perform automatic memory management.
    Java programs compile to bytecode that can be run on a Java Virtual Machine, or JVM for short.
    When Java programs run on the JVM, objects are created on the heap, which is a portion of memory 
    dedicated to the program. Eventually, some objects will no longer be needed. The garbage collector 
    finds these unused objects and deletes them to free up memory.
